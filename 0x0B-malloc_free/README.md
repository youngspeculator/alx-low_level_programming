here is a simple explanation of malloc:
Imagine you're a software engineer building a house of data, and you need some extra space to store things. "malloc" is like a magical tool you can use to create a new room in your house.

Here's how it works:

Requesting Space: When you use "malloc" in your program, you're essentially asking the computer to give you a chunk of memory.
You tell it how much space you need, like asking for a room of a certain size.

Getting the Room: The computer finds a suitable chunk of memory in its memory pool and gives it to you. Think of it as the computer building a new room in your data house.

Using the Space: Once you have that room (memory), you can store data in it. You can put integers, characters, or any other kind of information you need.

Keeping Track: "malloc" also keeps track of how much space you've taken and where your room is located, so you can find it when you need it.

Returning the Room: When you're done with the room, you should return it using "free." This tells the computer that it can reuse that space for something else later.

In simple terms, "malloc" is like asking the computer to give you some space to store your data temporarily, and it's your responsibility to use it properly and return it when you're done.

It's a fundamental tool for managing memory in programming
