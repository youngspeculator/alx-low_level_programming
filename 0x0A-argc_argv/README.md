argc and argv are specific variables used in C and C++ (and some other programming languages) to work with command-line arguments when calling the main() function. Let me explain how they relate to the concept of arguments in main():

argc (Argument Count): This is a variable that holds the number of arguments passed to the main() function when the program is run. It's an integer (whole number) that tells you how many arguments have been provided.

argv (Argument Vector): This is an array of strings that stores the actual arguments as text. Each element of the array is a string, and each string represents one of the arguments passed to the program
