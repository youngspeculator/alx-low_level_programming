A C static library, also known simply as a "static library" or "archive," is a collection of compiled C code that is bundled together into a single file.
It is created for the purpose of reusing code in multiple programs without having to recompile the code each time.
Static libraries are an essential part of the software development process, providing a way to organize and distribute reusable code components.
