A singly-linked list is a data structure used in computer science and programming for organizing a collection of elements called nodes.

Each node in a singly-linked list consists of two parts:
Data: This part holds the value or data associated with the node. It can be of any data type, depending on the application.
Next Pointer: This part contains a reference or pointer to the next node in the sequence. It essentially establishes the connection between nodes.

In a singly-linked list, the nodes are connected sequentially, with each node pointing to the next node in the list.
The last node in the list typically has its next pointer set to NULL (or an equivalent sentinel value) to indicate the end of the list.
